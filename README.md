# FSF Tweaks Lite

This is a fork of some FSF Tweaks I personally use, less XML Extension Dependancy.
Of course, there are **no mod settings** now, so if **you want to edit ou disable a tweak, you have to go into the /Patches Folder and change things as you like, or delete the patches you don't want**.

Warning : it does NOT contains all FSF Tweaks

If you want a tweak from FSF Collection which isn't included here, you can ask me here or on discord (#cyreneen).

LIST OF TWEAKS INCLUDED

- Encounter Map Tweaks generates ancient danger & mineable ressources
- Herd Migration on any biomes
- Ideology better mining worksites

- Ideology raider precept no workspeed malus
- Ideology rancher meme no plant work malus

As always this will not be put on the workshop.
