# FSF Tweaks Lite

This is a fork of some FSF Tweaks I personally use, less XML Extension Dependancy.

Of course, there are **no mod settings** now, so if **you want to edit ou disable a tweak, you have to go into the /Patches Folder and change things as you like, or delete the patches you don't want**.

1.4 and 1.5 version compatible

Warning : it does **NOT** contains all FSF Tweaks.

If you want a tweak from FSF Collection which isn't included here, you can ask me here or on discord (#cyreneen). Feel free to make PR's to include what you want.

LIST OF TWEAKS INCLUDED

- Encounter maps generates ancient danger & mineable ressources
- Herd Migration on any biomes
- Ideology better mining worksites
- Ideology art production specialist 
- Ideology more colours
- Ideology no conflicting memes
- Ideology raider precept no workspeed malus
- Ideology rancher meme no plant work malus
- Indoor tree farms
- More raid varied loot
- Quest reward pawns show bio and stats
- Randy Random incident Fixes
- Tidy crops textures

The reasoning behind not include some of the tweaks are : some mods do it better and Tweaks Galore from Neurotix can act as a replacement for them.

As always this will not be put on the workshop.

important note : Ideology is a **hard requirement** since I was too lazy to set up load folders for it.
